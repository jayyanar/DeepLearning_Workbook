    "<b>So what was it that allowed researchers to overcome the vanishing gradient problem? The\n",
    "answer to this question has two parts, the first of which involves a Restricted Boltzmann\n",
    "Machine. This is a method that can automatically find patterns in our data by reconstructing\n",
    "the input. Sounds complicated, but bear with me. We’ll take a closer look.\n",
    "Geoff Hinton at the University of Toronto was one of the first researchers to devise\n",
    "a breakthrough idea for training deep nets.His approach led to the creation of the Restricted\n",
    "Boltzmann Machine, also known as the RBM. Because of his pioneering work he’s often\n",
    "referred to as one of the father’s of deep learning.\n",
    "An RBM is a shallow, two-layer net; the first layer is known as the visible layer and the\n",
    "second is called the hidden layer. Each node in the visible layer is connected to every\n",
    "node in the hidden layer. An RBM is considered “restricted” because no two nodes in the\n",
    "same layer share a connection.\n",
    "An RBM is the mathematical equivalent of a two-way translator – in the forward pass,\n",
    "an RBM takes the inputs and translates them into a set of numbers that encode the inputs.\n",
    "In the backward pass, it takes this set of numbers and translates them back to form the\n",
    "re-constructed inputs. A well-trained net will be able to perform the backwards translation\n",
    "with a high degree of accuracy. In both steps, the weights and biases have a very important\n",
    "role. They allow the RBM to decipher the interrelationships among the input features, and they also help\n",
    "the RBM decide which input features are the most important when detecting patterns.\n",
    "Through several forward and backward passes, an RBM is trained to reconstruct the input\n",
    "data. Three steps are repeated over and over through the training process:\n",
    "a) With a forward pass, every input is combined with an individual weight and one overall\n",
    "bias, and the result is passed to the hidden layer which may or may not activate. Here’s\n",
    "how it flows for the whole net. b) Next, in a backward pass, each activation\n",
    "is combined with an individual weight and an overall bias, and the result is passed\n",
    "to the visible layer for reconstruction. Here’s how it flows back.\n",
    "c) At the visible layer, the reconstruction is compared against the original input to\n",
    "determine the quality of the result.\n",
    "RBMs use a measure called KL Divergence for step c); steps a) thru c) are repeated with\n",
    "varying weights and biases until the input and the re-construction are as close as possible.\n",
    "Have you ever had to train an RBM in one of your own machine learning projects? Please\n",
    "comment and tell me about your experiences.\n",
    "An interesting aspect of an RBM is that the data does not need to be labelled. This turns\n",
    "out to be very important for real-world data sets like photos, videos, voices, and sensor\n",
    "data – all of which tend to be unlabelled. Rather than having people manually label the\n",
    "data and introduce errors, an RBM automatically sorts through the data, and by properly adjusting\n",
    "the weights and biases, an RBM is able to extract the important features and reconstruct\n",
    "the input. An important note is that an RBM is actually making decisions about which input\n",
    "features are important and how they should be combined to form patterns. In other words,\n",
    "an RBM is part of a family of feature extractor neural nets, which are all designed to recognize\n",
    "inherent patterns in data. These nets are also called autoencoders, because in a way,\n",
    "they have to encode their own structure.\n",
    "So we saw that an RBM can extract features, but how does that help with the vanishing\n",
    "gradient? We’ll get to the second part of our answer in the next video when we take\n",

    "with a built-in feedback loop, allowing it to act as a forecasting engine. Let’s take\n",
    "a closer look.\n",
    "]Recurrent neural networks, or RNNs, have a long history, but their recent popularity\n",
    "is mostly due to the works of Juergen Schmidhuber, Sepp Hochreiter, and Alex Graves. Their applications\n",
    "are extremely versatile – ranging from speech recognition to driverless cars.\n",
    "All the nets we’ve seen up to this point have been feedforward neural networks. In\n",
    "a feedforward neural network, signals flow in only one direction from input to output,\n",
    "one layer at a time. In a recurrent net, the output of a layer is added to the next input\n",
    "and fed back into the same layer, which is typically the only layer in the entire network.\n",
    "You can think of this process as a passage through time – shown here are 4 such time\n",
    "steps. At t = 1, the net takes the output of time t = 0 and sends it back into the net\n",
    "along with the next input. The net repeats this for t = 2, t = 3, and so on.\n",
    "Unlike feedforward nets, a recurrent net can receive a sequence of values as input, and\n",
    "it can also produce a sequence of values as output. The ability to operate with sequences\n",
    "opens up these nets to a wide variety of applications. Here are a few examples. When the input is\n",
    "singular and the output is a sequence, a potential application is image captioning. A sequence\n",
    "of inputs with a single output can be used for document classification. When both the\n",
    "input and output are sequences, these nets can classify videos frame by frame. If a time\n",
    "delay is introduced, the net can statistically forecast the demand in supply chain planning.\n",
    "Have you ever used an RNN for one of these applications? If so, please comment and share\n",
    "your experiences.\n",
    "Like we’ve seen with previous deep learning models, by stacking RNNs on top of each other,\n",
    "you can form a net capable of more complex output than a single RNN working alone.\n",
    "Typically, an RNN is an extremely difficult net to train. Since these nets use backpropagation,\n",
    "we once again run into the problem of the vanishing gradient. Unfortunately, the vanishing\n",
    "gradient is exponentially worse for an RNN. The reason for this is that each time step\n",
    "is the equivalent of an entire layer in a feedforward network. So training an RNN for\n",
    "100 time steps is like training a 100-layer feedforward net – this leads to exponentially\n",
    "small gradients and a decay of information through time.\n",
    "There are several ways to address this problem - the most popular of which is gating. Gating\n",
    "is a technique that helps the net decide when to forget the current input, and when to remember\n",
    "it for future time steps. The most popular gating types today are GRU and LSTM. Besides\n",
    "gating, there are also a few other techniques like gradient clipping, steeper gates, and\n",
    "better optimizers.\n",
    "When it comes to training a recurrent net, GPUs are an obvious choice over an ordinary\n",
    "CPU. This was validated by a research team at Indico, which uses these nets on text processing\n",
    "tasks like sentiment analysis and helpfulness extraction. The team found that GPUs were\n",
    "able to train the nets 250 times faster! That’s the difference between one day of training,\n",
    "and over eight months!\n",
    "So under what circumstances would you use a recurrent net over a feedforward net? We\n",
    "know that a feedforward net outputs one value, which in many cases was a class or a prediction.\n",
    "A recurrent net is suited for time series data, where an output can be the next value\n",
    "in a sequence, or the next several values. So the answer depends on whether the application\n",
    "calls for classification, regression, or forecasting.\n",

    "    when you start applying labels. Autoencoders are an important family of neural networks\n",
    "    that are well-suited for this task. Let’s take a look.\n",
    "    In a previous video we looked at the Restricted Boltzmann Machine, which is a very popular\n",
    "    example of an autoencoder. But there are other types of autoencoders like denoising and contractive,\n",
    "    just to name a few. Just like an RBM, an autoencoder is a neural net that takes a set of typically\n",
    "    unlabelled inputs, and after encoding them, tries to reconstruct them as accurately as\n",
    "    possible. As a result of this, the net must decide which of the data features are the\n",
    "    most important, essentially acting as a feature extraction engine.\n",
    "    Autoencoders are typically very shallow, and are usually comprised of an input layer, an\n",
    "    output layer and a hidden layer. An RBM is an example of an autoencoder with only two\n",
    "    layers. Here is a forward pass that ends with a reconstruction of the input. There are two\n",
    "    steps - the encoding and the decoding. Typically, the same weights that are used to encode a\n",
    "    feature in the hidden layer are used to reconstruct an image in the output layer.\n",
    "    Autoencoders are trained with backpropagation, using a metric called “loss”. As opposed\n",
    "    to “cost”, loss measures the amount of information that was lost when the net tried\n",
    "    to reconstruct the input. A net with a small loss value will produce reconstructions that\n",
    "    look very similar to the originals.\n",
    "    Not all of these nets are shallow. In fact, deep autoencoders are extremely useful tools\n",
    "    for dimensionality reduction. Consider an image containing a 28x28 grid of pixels. A\n",

    "Sometimes it’s useful to discover the hierarchical structure of a set of data, such as the parse\n",
    "trees of a group of sentences. In these cases, Recursive Neural Tensor Networks, or RNTNs,\n",
    "are a better fit than feedforward or recurrent nets. Let’s take a closer look and see why.\n",
    "RNTNs were conceived by Richard Socher of MetaMind as part of his PhD thesis at Stanford.\n",
    "The purpose of these nets was to analyze data that had a hierarchical structure. Originally,\n",
    "they were designed for sentiment analysis, where the sentiment of a sentence depends\n",
    "not just on its component words, but on the order in which they’re syntactically grouped.\n",
    "So let’s take a look at the structure of an RNTN. An RNTN has three basic components\n",
    "– a parent group, which we’ll call the root, and the child groups, which we’ll\n",
    "call the leaves. Each group is simply a collection of neurons, where the number of neurons depends\n",
    "on the complexity of the input data. As you can see, the root is connected to both leaves,\n",
    "but the leaves are not connected to each other. Technically speaking, the three components\n",
    "form what’s called a binary tree. In general, the leaf groups receive input, and the root\n",
    "group uses a classifier to fire out a class and a score. We’ll get to the significance\n",
    "of these two values in a moment. An RNTN’s structure may seem simple, but just like a\n",
    "recurrent net, the complexity comes from the way in which data moves throughout the network.\n",
    "In the case of an RNTN, this process is recursive.\n",
    "To see how this recursion works, let’s take a look at an example. Let’s feed an English\n",
    "sentence into the net, and receive the sentence’s parse tree as output. At step one, we feed\n",
    "the first two words into leaf groups one and two, respectively. As a practical note, the\n",
    "leaf groups do not actually receive the words per say, but rather vector representations\n",
    "of the words. A vector is just an ordered set of numbers, and it’s been shown that\n",
    "these nets work best with very specific vector representations – particularly, good results\n",
    "are achieved when the numbers in the two vectors encode the similarities between the two words,\n",
    "when compared to other words in the vocabulary. The exact details of this process are beyond\n",
    "the scope of this video.\n",
    "The two vectors move across the net to the root, which processes them and fires out two\n",
    "values – the class and the score. The score represents the quality of the current parse,\n",
    "and the class represents an encoding of a structure in the current parse. This is the\n",
    "point where the net starts the recursion. At the next step, the first leaf group now\n",
    "receives the current parse, rather than a single word. The second leaf group receives\n",
    "the next word in the sentence. At this point, the root group would output the score of a\n",
    "parse that is three words long. This continues until all the inputs are used up, and the\n",
    "net has a parse tree with every single word included.\n",
    "This simplified example illustrates the main idea behind an RNTN; but in a practical application,\n",
    "we typically encounter more complex recursive processes. Rather than use the next word in\n",
    "the sentence for the second leaf group, an RNTN would try all of the next words, and\n",
    "eventually, vectors that represent entire sub-parses. By doing this at every step of\n",
    "the recursive process, the net is able to analyze – and score – every possible syntactic\n",
    "parse.\n",
    "Have you ever had to work with data where the underlying patterns were hierarchical?\n",
    "Please comment and let us know what you learned.\n",
    "Shown here are three possible parse trees for the same sentence. To pick the best one,\n",
    "the net relies on the score value produced by the root group. By using this score to\n",
    "select the best substructure at each step of the recursive process, the net will produce\n",
    "the highest-scoring parse as its final output.\n",
    "Once the net has the final structure, it backtracks through the parse tree in order to figure\n",
    "out the right grammatical label for each part of the sentence. Here, it does that one first\n",
    "and labels it as a noun phrase. Then it works on this, and you get a verb phrase. It then\n",
    "works its way up, and when it reaches the top, it adds a special label that signifies\n",
    "the beginning of the parse structure.\n",
    "RNTNs are trained with backpropagation by comparing the predicted sentence structure\n",
    "with the proper sentence structure obtained from a set of labelled training data. Once\n",
    "trained, the net will give a higher score to structures that are more similar to the\n",
    "parse trees that it saw in training.\n",
    "RNTNs are used in natural language processing for both syntactic parsing and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "They are also used to parse images, typically when an image contains a scene with many different\n",
    "components.\n",
    "In the next video, we’ll take a closer look at the many applications of Deep Learning."
